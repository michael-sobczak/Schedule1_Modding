# A Schedule One Mono / Il2Cpp Cross Compatibility Layer
S1API is an open source collaboration project to help standardize Schedule One modding processes.
The goal is to provide a standard place for common functionalities so you can focus on making content versus reverse engineering the game.

S1API was originally created by KaBooMa as an open source collaboration project to help standardize Schedule One modding processes.
This fork (GitHub: ifBars/S1API) continues development with updates, fixes, and improvements while keeping the same spirit and goals.

## Do I need this?
If you're using or plan to use any mods that depend on S1API, then yes. 

## How do I manually install this mod?
Installation is pretty straight-forward.
- Download the ZIP file from Nexus Mods or Thunderstore.
- Extract all files locally so you have them in a folder.
- Copy the `Plugins/` and `Mods/` folder into your `Schedule I` folder.
  - This is typically found under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I\`

**To uninstall, remove the associated plugins and mods files from the respective directories.**

## How do I use this to make mods?
